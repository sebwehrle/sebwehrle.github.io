I am an economist specializing in the economics of renewable energy systems and hold a Magister degree in economics from 
the University of Vienna and a doctoral degree from BOKU University.
My research centers on integrating social costs into energy system planning and has been published in leading journals 
in the field.

Currently, I work as a lead quantitative analyst for [Wien Energie](https://www.wienenergie.at) and am affiliated with 
[BOKU University](https://www.boku.ac.at).
My past work has guided Wien Energieâ€™s strategic development and helped shape key energy policy measures in Vienna, 
including initiatives related to climate protection areas. 
My professional experience spans advisory work for both municipal and multinational organizations, assisting with 
investment planning and decarbonization strategies.

I have expertise in power system modeling and scientific programming, having developed open-source tools such as _medea_ 
and [_cleo_](https://github.com/sebwehrle/cleo) to analyze renewable energy systems. 

### Research Interests:
* Externalities of renewable electricity generation technologies, particularly wind power
